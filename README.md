# IS-691_Lab_6

This is a lab from CYBR-691 at UMBC, Introduction to Reverse Engineering.
The objective of this lab was to reverse engineer a maze application and write a 
program that would find the quickest path.

The reason for posting this is for a reference on the use of the ctypes Python module
to interact with a Linux .so file.
